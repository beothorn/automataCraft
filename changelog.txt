7.0

- Big change: any block can now be replaced, central block does not need to be an automata anymore
- New structure: A rule30 implementation
- Pattern is excluded from replacement so executing the automata will not brake the pattern

Regressions:

- Superflat world crashes

========================
6.0

- Start block has 3 textures for each state (searching automata, loading pattern and executing)
- Each 9x3x3 now needs a terminator, this removes the sequenceÂ´s limit and fix the freeze on no terminator bug
- Added TNT block placeholder

========================
5.0

- Huge performance and stability improvement by using a single TileEntity instead of one per automata.
- CaveAir now matches any block.
- Automatas are not destroyed anymore if start block is destroyed
- New automata block texture
