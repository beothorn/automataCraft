# AutomataCraft

A minecraft mod that adds a block that displaces other blocks.

The block is programmable with other blocks by giving two patterns, 
match blocks and result blocks.

This mod adds:

- An automata block
- A termination block
- An air placeholder block
- A water placeholder block
- A magma placeholder block
- A automata placeholder block

To use it add a terminator block, a 3x3 block construction for the match blocks,
another 3x3 block construction for the result blocks, another terminator and the automata block.

After creating the pattern, the automata will start working when the Terminator block is removed.

Empty blocks (air) matches any block type.

## Example 1: pulls a dirty block one position up

Suppose you want to create an automata that pulls a dirty block one position up and moves one block.

You could do this:

ğŸŸ  : Automata block

ğŸŸ¦ : Automata placeholder block

ğŸŸ¥ : Terminator

ğŸŸ¨ : Empty (air)

ğŸŸ« : Dirt

ğŸŸª : Not evaluated

ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸªğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ«ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¥??????ğŸŸ 
ğŸŸªğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ«ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
```
 
Explanation:

First column has the terminator block. Anything around it is not taken into consideration.

Second has 9 empty (air) blocks. When evaluated this will match any configuration of blocks.

On the third column, the center block is not considered because it will always be an automata block.
The block under the automata is dirt (that is different from grass)

Fourth column has 9 empty (air) blocks. When evaluated this will match any configuration of blocks.

This is the last column from the matcher blocks. If the blocks around the automata matches this, 
it will replace all blocks with the blocks from the result.

Fifth column has 9 empty (air) blocks, this means that whatever blocks are there, they will not be replaced.

Sixth column has a dirt block in the center, this will replace the automata block.

Seventh column has an Automata placeholder. When the automata runs it will add a new automata block at this position.

Then a terminator and up to 20 ignored blocks before the autoata block.

# Example 2: Many patterns

If you want more than one pattern just add the next sequence and then the terminator at the end.

# Example 3: Glass corridor downwards

# Example 4: Maze solver
